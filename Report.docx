Before looking into the final grades I realized that the grades that I received from the program from what I could observe is that the final test is worth more than the rest at forty, the midterm is worth twentypercent of the final grade and the in class tests were surprisingly low at only ten percent. So, to calculate the final grade I took the average of all the assignment grades, which was the total of all grades combined divided by 7 and stored it as the variable “AAverage”. I also took the average of all the tests grades and stored them as a variable called “TestAverage” and these variables helped me to keep track of the numbers that I needed to use in the formula to calculate the E value with the formula provided. Also, that the assignments average grade are worth more in determining the E variable than the tests at thirty percent. Another thing that I noticed is that the E value system in grading gives a good amount of room for the students to climb back up in grading after not doing well on a singular assignment or test, giving them ample reasons to always try their hardest and continue to work on all the assignments to the best of their abilities. When a student did good in the whole class it automatically did all of the different weights to all the assignments and tests so it is built for people who do not make high grades in every assignment and test. When calculating the final grade of the class in the formula there was an error where the final was calculating as a percentage of 1 instead of being out of 100 which was needed to accurately calculate it so to do that I multiplied the E variable by 100 to ensure the grade was accurate. Furthermore, when entering the numbers from the file into the program I wanted to make sure that the numbers entered were between 1and100, so I implemented an if statement to ensure that the numbers were between 1 and 100, and if it was not I asked the user to re-enter the number as a whole number between 1 and 100. I also noticed that when the number is between 60 and 80 it usually goes up in percentage by a little bit, but usually the numbers are around the same value as the E value. I also noticed that if you perform badly on the in-class tests you can easily pick up your grade percentage by doing well on the midterm and final exams but also on the assignments.
